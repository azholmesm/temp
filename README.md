Temp repository (?) for experimentation
It is not clear to me how I can use this site.  I will use this "project" to learn how to get started with a goal of:
I have a football pool that I would like to use as an exercise in using this site for webpage creation/automation.
= I will need a page/form for users to create their individual entry.
  + This form will have restrictions to availability/elegibility of player choices.
  + When submitted, this form will create an "entry" that is read by the main pool page.
= The main page/code/app/??? will input and track the entries, automatically calculate the scores and provide/create a main webpage for users to monitor.
  + There will be some prediction/modelling done based on the status of the current scores and possible projected scoring.
